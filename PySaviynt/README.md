Here's a sample `README.md` for your `PySaviynt` library, including a basic usage example for the `Authentication` class:

```markdown
# PySaviynt

PySaviynt is a Python library designed to interact with the Saviynt Security Manager API. It simplifies the process of making API requests by providing a set of easy-to-use classes and methods that handle authentication, user management, access reviews, and more.

## Installation

To install PySaviynt, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install pysaviynt
```

Alternatively, you can clone this repository and install it manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pysaviynt.git
cd pysaviynt
python setup.py install
```

## Usage

### Authentication

To use PySaviynt, you first need to authenticate with the Saviynt API. Here is how you can do it using the `Authentication` class:

```python
from pysaviynt import Authentication

# Initialize the Authentication class with the base URL of the Saviynt API
auth = Authentication(base_url='https://api.saviynt.com')

# Log in with your credentials
access_token = auth.login(username='your_username', password='your_password')

if access_token:
    print("Authentication successful. Access token:", access_token)
else:
    print("Authentication failed.")
```

This will output the authentication status and show your access token if the login is successful.

## Features

- **Authentication**: Handle API login and token management.
- More features will be added here as the library develops.
